EconoMyst
=====================

A mobile app that tracks stock market values and macroeconomic statistics and
stores them in a user dashboard. EconoMyst is a non-deployed, non-commercial hybrid Ionic app I developed for my Galvanize Cohort G43 Capstone project in June 2017.

## Running the app locally on a browser
```
npm install
```
```
ionic serve
```
